# FiveM-Obtain-Position
A simple script that grabs the player's current position and saves it to a json file.

# Install:
Download the latest release of the script.
Create a folder in the resources folder and extract the contents of the downloaded zip into the new folder.

# Usage:
Once installed and running on the server, simply press backspace to obtain the current position of the player.
The current position will be shown in the F8 console, as well as in the server console. It will also be saved to a json file.

# Neat Feature:
One can simply obtain multiple positions and they will be saved in a table on the server, for the current session, which will also be saved to a json file each time a new position is obtained.
